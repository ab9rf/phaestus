========

Haskell library for parsing (and possibly doing other things to) PHP code.

The lexer and parser are designed in consultation with, but are not really 
derived from in any sensible way, the reference grammar and lexer from the
[php github repository](https://github.com/php/php-src/tree/master/Zend).
